These structure docs were reviewed and used as source context for this Papers pack:
- `structure/readme`
- `structure/Module_Development_Guide.md`
- `structure/all_documents_main.md`
- `structure/datai_documents_forensics_repository_addform_wrapup_v1.md`
- `structure/papers/papers_module_spec_definitive.md`
- `structure/papers/papers_module_task_plan.md`
- `structure/database/datai_light.sql`
- `structure/database/datai_with_data.sql`

Use them as secondary references; this folder is the primary implementation guide for Papers delivery.
