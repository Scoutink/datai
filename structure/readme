This is an index for the files in this folder, "structure":

code_tree.md: This is the codebase directory tree where you see the files structure and where is what.
Module_Development_Guide.md: How to add new "module" to the plaform? This file is a solid start.
Files: all_documents_main.md and datai_documents_forensics_repository_addform_wrapup_v1.md analyse the All documents feature (module) in the platform with all its features integrated to many other features in the system. It is crucial to learn as it helps developing new features.
/database/ subfolder has two files. Datai_light which is the platform sceme without data and datai_with_data which is the same database but populated with data samples.

Important note:

These markdown files are a starter, a brainstorming level of analytics. It was created by studying sections of the code not fully (for example, we barely studied any file in the public subfolder in the codebase, samples of the resources subfolder, etc...). So you have to validate and double checkeverything before you apply anything from the documents. If anything is lacking or incomplete, you get back to me first with it, then after I approve your changes, we move forward with it.
